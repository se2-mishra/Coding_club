# Club Website
 ### SETU SAGAR MISHRA                  
 ##### 2 Feb 2023

The work is to maintain the events and interactions between the population and the club members.
The technologies used in it includes _**HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PHP and MySQL.**_ The purpose of the work is to simplify the 
process of event conduction. And manage the work of the club efficiently.
The problems we faced were designing the website that retrieves the every data from the database. So that 
it requires no or less maintenance in the future.
We are thinking of adding the news and feeds features in the future to make the students updated. And we are also plannig to make the 
fully functional website. 

### For running it into localhost server:
**Using xampp**
1. save the folder(coding club) inside the htdocs
2. create database named 'codingclub'
3. create tables 'userinfodata' with parameters (id int(255) auto_increment, user varchar(255), email varchar(255),mobile varchar(255), branch varchar(255), year varchar(255));
4. create table 'gallery_images' with parameters (image_id int(11) auto_increment, image_name varchar(255), image_desc text default null, image_loc varchar(255));
5. After Actions of SQL and Apache has started, type in the browser 'http://localhost/Coding_club/index.php'
6. After the execution end the server
